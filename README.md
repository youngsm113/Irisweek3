# Week 3 Discussion: Iris Classification with Logistic Regression 
Classification problem using logistic regression on the scikit-learn Iris dataset to classify the species of Iris based on iris features

## Dataset Information
The Iris dataset is a classic multi-class classification dataset. It contains data on 150 samples of iris flower species based on their features, such as sepal length and width and petal length and width. The goal of this machine learning exercise is to predict the species of the flower based on the data's features. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the features were standardized to ensure they had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

## Model
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify the Iris dataset into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolour, or Virginica using the training data.

## Evaluation
The trained model can make predictions on the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report. The confusion matrix is then visualized using a heatmap.

## Conclusion
The model achieves a high classification accuracy, indicating that logistic regression is effective for this problem.
